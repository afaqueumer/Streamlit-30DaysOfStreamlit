Spin up a cloud development environment

GitPod
To spin up a development environment on the cloud, we can use GitPod and this can be done simply by clicking on the following link:

Try it ðŸ‘‰ https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/dataprofessor/streamlit101/
As you can see from the URL above, a GitHub repo URL is appended after https://gitpod.io/#/ which essentially allow GitPod to spin up a development environment using instructions contained within the GitHub repo URL (namely in the requirements.txt file that specifically lists the Python libraries to install).

Note: There are other similar cloud development environment such as:
