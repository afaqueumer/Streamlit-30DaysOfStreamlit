# Streamlit-30DaysOfStreamlit
A fun challenge to learn and practice using Streamlit.

The challenge will move through three levels of difficulty: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

ðŸ“† Days 1-7 will cover beginner tasks such as setting up a local and cloud coding environment, installing the Streamlit library, and building your first Streamlit Hello World app.

ðŸ“† Days 8-23 will cover more intermediate topics. Each day may highlight a Streamlit command to use for creating and deploying a simple Streamlit app (e.g., build a simple app that uses the st.download_button command).

ðŸ“† Days 24-30 will enter more advanced subjects. Learn about session states and things like efficient data and memory handling for Streamlit apps.
